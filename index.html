            <p>There are three types of web development roles: developers who specialize in the user interface (“front-end”), those who write the underlying code for running all website operations (“back-end”), and those who manage all aspects of a website (“full stack”).</p>

            <p>Okay, that’s all well and good, but as freshers, we have a hell lot of questions and insecurities in our curious heads. We have no clue how the company works, no idea how to code (we are not taught any of the important stuff in college TBH) and it is even harder for some people who do not have a coding background at all. If you have that kind of a curious mind about coding and loads of questions such as what the hell is web development? or what is back-end development? CONGRATULATIONS! You have taken your first baby step as a developer. </p>
